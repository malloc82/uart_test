## Pesudocode:

__Start__:
;; Adjusting range to +/-2.5v
;; Adjusting threshold to 100mv --> 0a4 (roughly 100.10mv)
send : 0xB40000FF5100410a4081
                       ^^^ 
__Collect__:
if: sensor is full:
   send : 0xA4
   if: we want to collect another signal with the same threshold setting:
      send : 0x91
      goto : __Collect__
   else if: we want to collection another signal with different threshold setting:
      goto : __Start__ and adjust range & threshold level
   else: stop.

## Explanation:

0xB40000FF5100410a4081 --> 5 commands: 0xB40000 0xFF 0x5100 0x410a40 0x81

0xB40000: zero out memory content in sensor 4 (fifth) for testing
0xFF:     Reset all modules
0x5100:   set MDU's range to +/-2.5v
          There are total 3 ranges available: +/-2.5v, +/-5v, +/-10v 
0x410a40: set MDU's threshold level to 100.10mv
0x81:     enable MDU start to collect data.

0xA4:     download sensor 4's memory content
0x91:     start collecting data for another round with the same range & threshold setting

Note: Sensor state can be obtained by 0x10, which can tell if MDU is full or not.
